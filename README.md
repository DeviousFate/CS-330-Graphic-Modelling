How do I approach designing software?
I prefer to approach my projects with a structured idea that gives me bones on which to craft the flesh of project. This allows me to have a general target while still being able to adapt to changes in focus or directive over the course of the project's lifetime.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Throughout the project my ability to visualize and structure the end goal of a project has been sharpened. This allows me to better approach new problems and to compartmentalize individual aspects of an idea, in turn allowing me to avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by scope. 
Instead I can maintain focus and clarity in the individual pursuits of specific project goals.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Breaking up the steps of the project into smaller, more managable bits allowed me to focus efforts to better visualize the concept presented.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Fully understanding the scope of my project objectives will be important in every aspect of my work going forward. This project has helped to shape that skill, refining to a professional degree.

How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to developing programs is dictating by the program's eventual function. If it is something like this, using objective programs with singular function that can be called and customised are far greater in value than individually adjusting every aspect.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I continue to use an object oriented approach. Breaking the different project parts into customisable calls is far more valuable to scalability and function than my initial approach of coding each shape and object individually.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iterations of my work are starkly different, as each iteration I was able to complete opened a door for reflection and improvement in latter work.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goals professionally revolve around Cybersecurity and Software Engineering, both of which have their roots in Computer Science. The concepts and ideas taught in CS are integral to success in both industries.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Educationally, CG&V is a valuable course in the application of matrices and other important mathematics. In my linear algebra class for example, I struggled to grasp the ideas but once I encountered them in this course I was able to understand much easier.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, I'm unsure of the application in my career for the actual use of computational graphics. However the concepts introduced are very valuable. Breaking down the project step by step was an important aspect of my success in the course.
